Inside the docs directory, you will find usbmon.txt which is directly
taken from the Linux kernels documentation, which is under the GPL.

The "HID Usage tables" PDF has its own (C) statement inside (please refer
to that), which allows including it here for "internal use".

The documents are included for convenience.
